[{"question":"Prison is the best punishment for criminals.To what extent you agree or disagree?","main":"Sending people who commit a crime to  jail is  one of the ways to punish them and, after punishment, return them to  society. However, I believe that it is not the number solution to tackle crime or educate  criminals in order to avoid wrongdoings.I think that some criminals should be forgiven or fined instead of being sentenced. This is because they might have committed a crime by accident or committed a murder not on purpose.Sending criminals to jail is  one of the effective ways to keep  society safe. This is because if the person is a serial killer, who murdered many people should be imprisoned for his or her actions. By doing so, government and individuals can benefit  it from. For example, if we let the serious offender walk in the streets and kill people to gain power or money. This action could cause life threats to the citizens in this area. There is another way to rehabilitate criminals is to fine them or give them a second chance not to send them to prison immediately. This means paying a fine to the government to cover the bills can be a life-changing decision for the person who might have not committed a crime unintentionally. Another way is giving a great amount of community work that  can give a sense of belongings to the person who can feel themselves a part of the community. It helps them to return to  society in order to lead a normal life. In conclusion, sending the law-breakers to  jail can be  one of the solutions to the problem but they should be given another chance to live in  society normally by making them pay a fine or do some community work. I do think that both ways of punishing criminals ought to be taken into consideration.Submitted by omondavlat91 on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"7.0","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 6.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present6Supported main points6Accurate linking words9Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 8.08Varied vocabulary9Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"Some people think the government should pay for healthcare and education, but others believe it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion?","main":"How to finance the increasing costs of healthcare and education has become a major concern to most of us.While some insist that they should be provided by governments for free, others think otherwise, claiming that they are not the responsibility of the nation.Generally, I believe that the government should cover some parts of the bills.On the one hand, the government should make basic health care and educational opportunities accessible to every dweller, as a country's prosperity highly depends on the contribution made by its well-educated citizens who are in good health.They tend not only to have promising careers but  Add aÂ missing verb are show examplesalso able to cope with challenges. When the country undergoes changes and growth, it relies on everyone to adapt and prepare themselves for new opportunities. Thus,every country counts on the existence of a large group of literate and healthy citizens to lead social and economic development.On the other hand, it is unrealistic that the authority is responsible for all spending on citizens' health care and educational pursuits. The governmental budget is not unlimited, in which it needs to not only invest in national defence in a bid to protect the nation but offer financial support for infrastructure, and science development, to name but a few.However, the advent of an ageing society has been accompanied by increasing medical demands, and there is a growing need for higher education in the job market driven by technological developments. Therefore, it is almost impossible for the administrations to shoulder the onerous burden imposed by the medical care and education of the public today. This is especially true in some less developed countries with huge populations.To sum up, a healthy and educated society is the backbone of any successful nation; hence, the government should subsidize a certain proportion of the cost of medical and educational expenses.Submitted by 76805977 on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"7.0","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 6.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present6Supported main points9Accurate linking words9Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 8.09Varied vocabulary8Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"Topic: Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","main":"In some countries, people tend the host to follow their customs and others think that foreigners may do everything they want. It is clear that there are some differences between peoples' thoughts.Firstly, if it is thought that guests should get local behaviour and rules, these customs will be a great gift for our relatives. This makes them  feel  like a part of  society. It is not only saving the best behaviours but also something that every host can learn and do  in one's home as a good practice. Sometimes a human who goes to another country learns something interesting and does it in his own city. We can meet such situations especially when there are conferences and meetings. In such times all news is useful. So following customs may be excellent for everyone.On the other hand, it can make discomfort for visitors to do as a native community. It is not allowed them, for example, by their sight or by religion. Also, it may be that they just need to be free, for instance, in their clothes. As we know, in Europe people wear skirts, trousers, pairs can walk together, go to parks and even stay in each other's houses. In contrast, in Muslim countries, crowds wear long clothes, and women and men cannot go together and meet until they have a marriage.  In conclusion, both following local customs and doing everything as in one's hometown are very difficult questions and every government should choose its laws and allowances.Submitted by khoshimovkomronbek on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"7.0","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 6.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present6Supported main points9Accurate linking words6Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 8.08Varied vocabulary9Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"Allowing young children to do an enjoyable activity can develop better skills and more creativity than reading.To what extent do you agree? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.","main":"While reading is an essential tool of learning, there are various enjoyable activities such as playing sports, creative play, and solving puzzles that are most beneficial not only for children's mecognitivecdevelopmentlopment but also learning decision-making making and imagination skills. I  completely agree with the notion, and take you to the myriad of reasons to explain it in detail.To begin with, one of the fundamental factors that supports my point of view, is engaging kids in  pleasurable activities such as playing games, solving puzzles and other physical activities that will stimuphysicaleir physical growth as well as mental growth. Eventually, they will learn  teamwork, cooperation, and social interaction which will promote their aforementioned skills. For example; children can easily grab  interest and skills while enjoying their favourite activities which they do not learn by just reading  books.Furthermore, entertaining pursuits will also help in individual interest and strength. Every child has different preferences and interests, which can not be developed by reading common books. It can only be identified by involving children in those activities in which they have an interest and liking. In this way, they will be able to enhance their skills  and discover their passion, career, strengths and potential talent. Therefore, they can become renowned players, artists, doctors and researchers. To summarize, although there are many benefits of reading different books which increase the knowledge of the children,  physical activities play a vital role in the holistic development of the kids which foster their skills, interest, careers, passion and dreams.Submitted by deepamankaur208 on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"7.0","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 5.09Logical structure9Introduction &

addiction: Many people believe that social networking sites such as Facebook have a negative impact on both individuals and society.

Hence, the opponents hold the view that this trend has detrimental consequences for the community. While this essay will explore this phenomenon, I believe that social media will have negative effects on society in the long run.On the one hand, it is irrefutable that this trend has some advantages through the global village era. Firstly, it can strengthen social interactions through the Internet without any restrictions. Namely, Facebook transformed all aspects of relationships by facilitating connections among people. In addition, this trend can expand friendships through the network who have the same ideas or run any kind of campaign around the world for social interests.On the contrary, this trend has undeniable negative implications that we should consider it. Sharply, this medium would undermine mental health and physical activities.

Governments could better spend this money on other things to benefit the nation.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","main":"The space always fascinates people and people are trying to explore as much as possible. In order to discover new features of  space, countries often spend too much money. But, there are some people who say that governments should have spent this money on the things which can make a better nation. There are some advantages and disadvantages in both terms.On the one hand, people have discovered a lot of interesting stuff in  space and those findings always entertained people. For example, when the first astronauts got to the moon with the spaceship, people were amazed and it still excites people nowadays. In addition, there is the problem of the earth. The earth will have short resources and people might have to move to another planet. Recently, in space industries, they challenge to find a new planet where people can live and struggle to find one.On the other hand, spending money on space explanation is often wasted. For example, using money in  space doesn't mean discovering new things all the time. Therefore, people often think that is wasting and people have to get treated better than dreaming stuff. Furthermore, governments should use money for people's actual lives such as medication and developing the countries. For instance, some countries have  problems that medication is  high priced and poor people can't afford it , so they don't get medication like others. Moreover, young people often struggle to get the education that they want because  tuition fees are set very expensive. So, governments should help people who hold problems and stop spending too much money on  space explanation.In conclusion, countries should pay attention to themselves and their people.

To what extent do you agree or disagree","main":"It is common that high-ranking executives in most companies and organizations earn higher salaries than ordinary workers. In my opinion, this is quite reasonable.The first reason for their higher earnings is that top-level executives tend to take on more responsibilities and make greater contributions. There is no denying that the growth of a corporation depends largely on the hard work of all staff, but key decisions, including setting strategic goals, making important decisions and leading the team to achieve the goal, can only be planned and implemented by the decision-makers in a group. Therefore, they deserve the higher pay.Another fact is that the amount of salary grows with his ability and experience. To be a qualified leader, people need to work for years, during which they can improve their skills and gain rich experience. Thus, when they reach the high-level management of the enterprise, it is justified that they can earn higher than low-level staff. Also, the high earning would be an incentive for people to work harder for promotion in their careers.    However, opponents may argue that salary should not be determined by his position and executives are not necessarily more excellent than their subordinates. But what we are discussing refers to the general situation in most companies. When other factors are difficult to be assessed, the rank in an organization is an important criterion to reflect the ability and contribution to the team.Overall, it is reasonable that those at higher positions are paid more than those at lower positions in an organization, which is largely relevant to the contribution, skill, experience, and responsibility.Submitted by 76805977 on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.5","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 4.04Logical structure4Introduction & conclusion present6Supported main points7Accurate linking words9Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 9.09Varied vocabulary9Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"Nowadays, older people who need employment have to compete with younger people.

In this essay, I will discuss suggestions for solving this issue that  is increasing day by day in today's society.To begin with, older people are putting aside for employment,due to the fact that even if they have more experience in the work industry, they are no longer providing the energy and the enthusiasm that a young adult does. For example, elderly people might not provide the requirements that factories or business companies ask for. They can find it exhausting in dealing with  modern technology which can be a key factor for employment.Elderly people are often rejected as an employee due to the lack of dealing with modern gadgets and how they can put their lives in danger if they work too hard.On the other hand, communities should help with the lack of employment for  elderly people. Old people can have a number of qualities that companies can benefit from .For example, elderly people tend to be more patient than  younger employees and also pay more attention. They can deal with situations that younger people find  hard ,  quite calm as they are more experimented than them in certain fields.In conclusion, old people might not be as good as they once were, however, that does not mean that they should not have the right to employment, society  should keep a balance with employers that are young or old so that we can help both generations to procure their career.Submitted by annaungureanu794 on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.5","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 6.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present6Supported main points9Accurate linking words6Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 6.06Varied vocabulary9Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"In some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problem as a result of eating to much fast food. It is neccesary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. To what extent do you agree or disagree","main":"Fast food is very common in almost all countries and its demand is consistently increasing. In some ,nations a large number of people are becoming unfit due to excessive consumption of junk food. I agree that increasing taxes on this category of food will definitely reduce the demand, I also think at a certain point people will not stop eating it because they are addicted to it.The prime factor responsible, for society consuming fast food is because it is very cheap and easily available in the market. On average out of 10 people 8 eat these kinds of food every day and harms their digestive system as well as their heart. Imposing taxes on these kinds of food is a great initiative to stop them from consuming it. Moreover, the public will also spend the same money on fruits or healthy food, which as a result protects them from chronic diseases. For instance, in some cities of ,India the ruling authorities have increased tax rates by 18% on all categories of junk food, due to which demand has significantly reduced.However, it is an undeniable fact that addiction to anything is very harmful to each individual, imposing higher taxes will definitely reduce the sale of junk food but ,still people will eat it because here money is not the concern.

However, others argue that other things like Television or friends have the most significant influence. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","main":"Few individuals believe that parents have the most significant role in a child's development whereas others opine that friends and television are more important. This essay intends to analyze both views along with my perspective.There are several reasons why parents have the most critical role in a child's development. Firstly, children spend most of their time with their parents. To explain it more, parents give proper knowledge to their children because children easily understand them. If parents do not give proper guidance to their children, they will see bad results in the future such as smoking, doing illegal activities, and joining criminal gangs. For instance, in Hinduism, people do not prefer to eat non-veg because they are taught from childhood that it is against our religion. As a result, most children live a peaceful and great life in the future due to having knowledge given by guardians.On the other hand, those who say that friends and TV have more important for a child's development. The first and foremost reason is that living or spending time with friends helps to improve children's confidence and improve communication skills. In addition to this, by watching television children learn a lot of things. If they watch a yoga program on tv, they will be interested in future for yoga classes. Parents should have details of their children's friends because a few masses choose a bad path in their life and it is affected our children.In conclusion, in my opinion, parents are playing a vital role in the development of their children in comparison to friends and television.

Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.","main":"Some people believe that teachers should not give their students homework. While there are benefits of giving homework to children, I would argue that it is better to not give homework to school children.First of all, giving homework to students helps them remember the knowledge which was taught at school. The children's brains will be able to remember those lessons more completely and greatly after doing homework day by day. For instance, when I complete my math homework, it helps me to learn the formula and remember how to do it so that if I meet exercises of the same kind in the future, I will be able to do them accurately and as simply as possible. On the other hand, not giving homework will give children more time to participate in some physical activities or do things they like, have a relaxed mind after a busy day at school and help them study effectively for the next lessons. As an example, in Vietnam's present educational system, homework assignments are practically required at all academic levels. And that makes me feel a lot of pressure after a hard day at school, having to complete extra homework that prevents me from getting any rest, and having to go to school every day with me is extremely exhausting. It is clear that if school children have no extra assignment they can do exercise, and relax after a hard day of school so they can prepare greatly for the next lessons.In conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students should not be given homework assignments. Instead, let them be free to do what they like and participate in physical activities.Submitted by jakedth162 on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.5","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 7.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present9Supported main points7Accurate linking words9Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 5.05Varied vocabulary9Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"School  children are becoming far too dependent on computers.

It is believed that teachers should try not to use computers while teaching. I completely disagree with this statement. This essay will discuss, how  computers are playing a significant role in alleviating carbon footprints from environmental and financial needs,Remove the commaapplyshow examples and nurturing kids' education in a better way.In the realm of education, technology plays an important role in enriching education. There are plenty of reasons why computers are assisting students in nurturing their education, for example: because teachers are not able to pay attention to all the students equally, students who are falling behind; can be helped in solving concepts which were missed during the classes. Another example of computers assisting juveniles with their education, is preschool kids tend to enjoy classes more which show animation on computers over the classes given on Blackboard.Moreover, not only computers are helping the environment by reducing dependency on textbooks, but they will also help in relaxing the pockets of student parents because they don't need to purchase notebooks. For instance, when I was in college, barely brought any books because I was able to find ebooks for most of the books for free. If students will be less dependent on books and notebooks then less deforestation will be done to meet their educational needs.To sum it up, I believe it is difficult to avoid using computers in day-to-day use. Although there are some drawbacks to using computers in classrooms but after analysing it is clear that computers bring more advantages by putting less strain on the environment and better assisting students in their curriculum.Submitted by mishrarahul256 on Thu Jul 06 2023","band":"6.0","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 4.04Logical structure4Introduction & conclusion present9Supported main points9Accurate linking words9Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 6.06Varied vocabulary8Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"in the modern world it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others.

As far as I am concerned, the benefits of using the internet in these realms surpass its drawbacks.The dominant merit of using the internet to communicate is that it breaks the restraint of locations and makes people keep in touch easily. More precisely, people just need to take a phone call in several seconds rather than a long journey to meet each other. For instance, in working situations, many colleagues are in different cities, but they can have an online meeting through applications such as ZOOM.  It is convenient to use the internet to have visible communication online, yet people do not need to go on a business trip anymore.In addition, the internetCapitalize wordInternetshow examples has offered various options for shopping. To be exact, people can browse several shops online in just a few hours and compare which one to buy. Merchants offer different types of displays, which include pictures, videos and even an artificial intelligence model. Thus, consumers can make their decisions through distinct brands or commodities' traits online.On the other hand, it is inevitable that peopleâs literary level is descending by relying on the internet. Since the internet has become prevalent, people are accustomed to using emojis or voice messages to express the contents rather than a whole sentence. Many formal grammar or difficult words are forgotten or misused on many occasions.

Furthermore, universities and researchers are usually in close cooperation with zoos in order to save endangered species.On the other handAdd aÂ comma,handshow examples the foremost reason that people explain zoo is not a good place for animals is because some living conditions like surrounding, temperature and freedom are not suitable for all animals in the same way. For instance, although zebras love to live in high-temperature areas  polar bears consist in cold atmospheres. And also some carnivores such as lions and tigers are required in a vast area. In addition to that  most environmentalists state that captivating animals in zoos are affected animals' mental health and physical well-being in a terrible way. If animals are being exposed to a large number of people is not good for their mentality. Considering all of these concerns, I believe that a human being should stand on the side of protecting animal rights. In conclusion, the debate surrounding the presence of wild animals in zoos involves valid arguments on both sides. While some people emphasize the positive aspects of confinements, others acknowledge the  freedom of animals and their health conditions. To strike a balance, it is crucial that animals have a natural right to freedom and should not be deprived of their liberty for human entertainment or education.Submitted by thisarigunawardhana on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.5","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 5.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present9Supported main points9Accurate linking words5Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 6.06Varied vocabulary7Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"these days, people work in more than one job, and often change career several times during their life.

Besides, changing careers often preventsChange the verb formpreventshow examples you from being bored and anxious. Working in the same place with the same people on similar projects can be tiring and boring. In many cases, people are looking for excitement and joy while working. Turning on the other side of the argument, one of the main disadvantages of changing careers and working in a variety of places is a lack of stability and belonging. In all, people that have more than one post may feel  exhausted from running in between. As  they are not stable in their life. Another important drawback is that besides learning and knowing a lot of things in different domains, which is good, they must be masters of none because they are focusing on making money rather than  expertise in one domain.

In this ,essay we are going to analyze the agreements and disagreements on the topic. There are many points to support the statement that games have a negative impact on children. To begin with, using a computer for long periods of time to play games can damage the eyes as the screen rays are too bad for the eyes. In other words, playing games for more time on the computer can be led to eye dryness or getting glasses. Therefore, it has been suggested that reading books is more beneficial than using a computer in daily life. Moreover, some games available in the market are also injurious to the mind as they use mind-disturbing graphics in the game. For example, there is a game called zombie world, in which players must hit the zombies and kill them. Even the faces of the zombies affect childrenâs minds and give them some concept on them. However, despite all disadvantages of playing computer games, some positive effects are also there. In , the market there are many games, which help to educate a child in game form. A game named \"Mathmind\" can teach many math problems to a child in an easy and effective way. Hence, Computer games also have some advantages.To conclude , computer games are affecting mentally this impact may cause severe health issues and even  death.Submitted by patels on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.5","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 6.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present6Supported main points9Accurate linking words7Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 7.07Varied vocabulary9Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"In the future books will exist only on computers.Do you agree?","main":"The growing technology is becoming a reason for many concerns, one of them being the future of paper books.Considering  Add anÂ article the show examplespopularity of ebooks,books can only see on computer screens in future. I strongly agreed with it and believe that it will be a positive trend.Reading books on the computer cost much less as compared to buy a physical book. This is to say that whenever we search for a book on a website such as  Amazon.com, Ebay.comCorrect word choiceor Ebay.comshow examples, we find a digital book is much cheaper than a hardcopyCorrect your spellinghard copyshow examples of the same book. In addition to that, there are many websites from where you can get a digital version of the book for free. For example, there is a website called Pdfdrive.com where millions of digital books are available for free, you do not even have to signup on that website for downloading a book.Another thing which promotes this trend is  people's awareness towards the environment. Everybody knows that the environment is a global concern and most   people are aware that paper production leads to harm to trees which will affect the environment. Considering that people use less paper as much as they can which is also leading to the vanishment of books. For example, many schools transformed their pen-paper-basedpaper-based study method and switch to the modern method of paperless study.In conclusion, it will be a great positive development in terms of technology as well as environmentally. These simple steps can be beneficial in the long term to rescue  the ecosystem.Submitted by shivamshandillya8 on Thu Jul 06 2023","band":"7.0","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 7.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present9Supported main points7Accurate linking words7Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 6.08Varied vocabulary6Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"Machine translation (MT) is slower and less accurate than human translation and there is no immediate or predictable likelihood of machines taking over this role from humans.","main":"The past century has witnessed great advances in technology. Among all the advancements we achieved, machine translation technology used to be believed to be an invention that was not so useful. From my perspective, however, with the rapid development of relevant theory and algorithms, machine translation could become mature in the near future.On the one hand, we cannot deny that machine translation technologies are still in their early stages. In many cases, they are still not capable of delivering reliable interpretations. To understand what people are saying, it is required to take into account the relationship between the speakers and their situations. Besides, another traditional obstacle that holds back this industry is that rather than only understandWrong verb formunderstandingshow examples the direct meaning of words and phrases, interpreters need to view the context and get a grasp of how it impacts the meaning of a sentence. Therefore, it is easy to understand the difficulties of designing such a strong machine.However, the rapid development of artificial intelligence and relevant algorithms today marked a new era where machines stand a good chance of taking over many jobs from humans, including translation and interpretation positions. New applications and devices are designed to have stronger power to analyse and compare thousands of millions of sentences and their correct translation results, so that the artificial intelligence in them may be allowed to truly understand how languages work and what affects the result. In this case, the preciseness of machine interpretation has been improved significantly.The dramatic development of technology has had a great impact on how people view machine translation. It improves the efficiency and reliability of such a process. In conclusion, my personal view is that machine interpretation is set to play a more significant role soonï¼thanks to the development of artificial intelligence.Submitted by anglexlj on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.5","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 6.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present6Supported main points7Accurate linking words6Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 7.07Varied vocabulary8Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"Some ex-prisoners commit crimes after being released from the prison. What do you think is the cause? How can it be solved","main":"The crime rate has been increasing rapidly in many places nowadays. It is reported that ex-prisoners continue committing crimes after being released. This essay will analyze the reason and offer possible solutions.There are many reasons that encourage former criminals to recommit. Formerly incarcerated individuals often find themselves lacking social support upon their release from prison. On the one hand , a great number of ex-prisoners lack vocational skills, which leaves them with no career options and thus no financial support. On the other hand, criminal background drastically decreases job opportunities as many employers hardly prefer to appoint an employee with criminal records, Additionally, people are not willing to accept ex-convicts to reside in their communities and tend to treat them with suspicion. Therefore, ex-prisoners are more vulnerable to committing criminal acts instead of becoming reintegrated into the community.However, these problems can be avoided to a large extent by governmental intervention. I believe that the government should make an effort to revolutionise the prison system where it can not only provide opportunities for prisoners to receive general education and vocational training but encourage corporations to hire people with criminal records who have turned over a new leaf. This can promote their independence by offering them the possibility of higher employment chances, greater engagement in society, and, above all, the restoration of individual self-esteem and social competence. Furthermore, the community should also change its mindset and attitude towards former prisoners and offer them the necessary emotional support, therefore stop committing crimes.To conclude, although there are several factors leading criminals to break the lawsFix the agreement mistakelawshow examples again, I am of the opinion that society as a whole should take responsibility to rehabilitate ex-criminals with active measures.Submitted by 76805977 on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.0","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 4.09Logical structure6Introduction & conclusion present4Supported main points9Accurate linking words7Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 8.09Varied vocabulary8Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"In many countries, formal exams are used to access studentâs abilities and to judge the success of their education.What are the advantages and disadvantages of using formal exams to assess studentsâ abilities ? Do you think the benefits of using formal exams outweigh the drawbacks ?","main":"Educational systems all around the world use formal examinations as a way of testing students' abilities and success rates. Although  it instils an unhealthy competitive sense among the students, it also has many benefits as examinations help in expressing our skillset. In my essay below, I will further discuss my opinion. Without examination, students might become lethargic and lose  interest to prove their skillset. Moreover, exams increase our creativity skills as we solve tough problems within a limited amount of time, and it teaches us how to handle pressure and difficult questions. Although it may sound fancy that just acquiring knowledge is enough,  one needs to express their knowledge and people should be able to quantify it. Hence, it makes sense that examinations are preferred in most countries to access a studentâs ability. That being said, some people see exams with a competitive sense and they compare themselves with other people, which creates a sense of pressure to perform well among others. Such behaviours should be avoided because people might go into depression or other disorders when they fail their examinations badly. Hence, people should see examinations as a way of accessing oneâs ability for their own development rather than seeing them as achievements.  In conclusion, although competitive exams create a lot of insecurity in  many people, it is most beneficial for oneâs growth and I believe certainly its advantages outweigh the drawbacks. If we see examinations as a natural way of accessing oneâs ability and getting rid of the unhealthy competitive sense and insecurities, we can improve our skillset to a greater extent, as, one can always try again and be better, and failures and success are not permanent.Submitted by hemaecengineer on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.0","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 4.09Logical structure9Introduction & conclusion present4Supported main points7Accurate linking words6Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 7.07Varied vocabulary9Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"Some people believe that everyone has a right to have access to University education and that government should make it free-for-all students no matter what financial background they have.

Firstly, children spend most of  Correct pronoun usage their show examplestime with parentsCorrect pronoun usagetheir parentsshow examples.

I personally agree with this viviewpointCorrect your spellingviewpoint. This essay will discuss the possible reasons related to this viewpoint.The foremost reason is that according to folk music is an efficient way of bringing individuals who have in Change prepositionapplyshow examplesdifferent backgrounds. In addition, music is not the language of a particular country. Consequently, individuals from wholeChange the articlethe wholeshow examples world are able to comprehend the meaning of sameChange the articlethe sameshow examples song through its melody.

I think,Remove the commaapplyshow examples when compared with working from officeAdd anÂ articlethe officean officeshow examples, there are more benefits, like maintaining employeesChange noun formemployees'employee'sshow examples moods and emotions, than drawbacks, such as being able to communicate with other coworkers and reducing misunderstandings, to working outside the workplace. On the one hand, working in flexible places could increase the employee's mental health. Workers should not use mobility to go forth and back from their office and home, which can affect their emotions and make them feel tired when they arrive at their office or home due to the traffic jams. Working at home with their smart devices could be a solution to this issue and help to maintain their mood and emotions. For example, working in the capital city, where many people are busiest and there are always traffic jams during office hours, makes people stressed, and working at home could be a solution to this problem.On the other hand, when the job requires more teamwork and collaboration, it is important to work at the office. It is because it makes it easy to communicate with other coworkers and reduces misperceptions and misunderstandings. For example, marketing positions need more collaboration and communication with other coworkers in their teams. So, it would be better if the marketing team worked in the office to easily communicate and collaborate with others. In addition, if there is a problem or target to achieve, it can be easy to catch up, meet, and discuss it immediately.I personally value maintaining mental health above all other factors when choosing a place to work. Therefore, I believe that working anywhere is a much better place to work, especially for workers who work and live in the capital city because of the traffic jams and busiest city. I also believe that most citizens nowadays prefer to do their work outside their workplace due to flexibility and comfort.Submitted by frens on Fri Jul 07 2023","band":"6.5","coherence":"Coherence and Cohesion: 4.04Logical structure4Introduction & conclusion present9Supported main points9Accurate linking words5Variety in linking words","lexical":"Lexical resource: 6.07Varied vocabulary6Accurate spelling & word formation"},{"question":"In number of countries, some people think it is necessary to spend large sums of money on constructing new railway lines for very fast trains between cities, Others believe the money should be spend on improving existing public transport.Disscuss both views and give your own opinion.","main":"The group of individuals in several nations believe that the government essentially ininvestCorrect your spellinginvests considerableCorrect article usagea considerableshow examples amount of money forChange prepositiontoshow examples buildWrong verb formbuildingshow examples nnovelCorrect your spellingnovel railtracksCorrect your spellingrail tracks for metroAdd anÂ articlethe metroshow examples to travel among the urban areas while others state that authorities should be priorities for growing commiunityCorrect your spellingcommunity conveyances.
